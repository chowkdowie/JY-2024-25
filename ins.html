                        Being a daily Instagram user I had sufficient knowledge about the technology. From
                        this, I wanted to gain a deeper understanding of other users’ pain points and
                        frustrations with the app.

                    Before I started defining my problem I researched online on

                    including Quora, Reddit, blogs, etc. Most feedback I saw led back
                    to a common issue that Instagram’s <b>content is not filtered well:</b>

                    Regarding the interface design, I conducted a heuristic
                    evaluation based on Jakob Nielson’s principles. Instagram
                    performed poorly on:<br>
                    <b>a) Consistency and standards</b><br>
                    • Certain icons are redundant and the same icon can be used for
                    different functions
                   <br>
                   <b>b) Flexibility and efficiency</b><br>
                    • Users are limited in what they can do during the process of
                    posting and editing posted content
                </div>

                    <button class="bubble-text-2 white" style="height:250px; margin-right: 70px;">
                        From the previous steps, the defined problem statement for this design project is:<br><br>
                        <b>Users find it challenging to explore content they are interested in and feel
                        disconnected on the current Instagram app with the interface lacking flexibility and
                        efficiency, this leads to decreased engagement and user satisfaction.</b><br><br>
                        At this point I have compiled some redesign aspects, however, I want to confirm and
                        further explore user pain points through user research.

                <div class="right"><b>What was the interview method?</b> <br>
                    I carried out a semi-structured interview approach to be able to
                    gather both specific answers that I could extrapolate into data,
                    as well as dive into their own thoughts about the app through
                    open-ended discussions. I conducted 1-on-1 informal interviews
                    with 5 Instagram users aged 18-20, with an average daily usage of
                    1.8 hours.<br><br>                
                    <b>Interview Takeways (x/5 mentioned)</b> <br>
                    • Enhance the algorithm for content recommendations such as
                    interest-based channels or curated collections.<br>
                    • Integrate more advanced photo and video editing features
                    directly into the app.<br>
                    • Integrate more easy to use modes/features that help users
                    manage their screen time, such as usage summaries, time limits,
                    and gentle reminders to take breaks.

                    I took inspiration from other apps such as Pinterest, Reddit,
                    Twitter, that would ask you to select topics of interests to show
                    you on your feed. With <b>users starting on the explore page</b>, I drew
                    three designs, settling on <b>C</b> as it was the most straightforward/
                    efficient layout which made it visually appealing due to its
                    simplicity.

                    heuristic of placing related elements close together. It avoids
                    being placed at the bottom to prevent users from accidentally

                    Following UI/UX standards for a consistent and cohesive

                    additional design changes to styles as during user research all
                    users rated the current interface high. Stemming from this point,
                    the new designed features utilized <b>rounded buttons</b> and
                    interactive components for <b>clicking and horizontal swipin</b>g.

                    <b>What was the interview method?</b><br>
                    I instructed 5 users to carry out a certain task and asked them
                    to narrate their thoughts and actions. I recorded these and
                    noticed any areas of struggle as well as feedback on the new
                    incorporated functions.<br><br>
                    Here is where challenges arose. Due to the time constraints, I
                    only provided them with a Figma prototype, however, sometimes the
                    user would be confused on what they press, or if they didn’t
                    press directly on the button nothing would happen. In these
                    instances I had to provide some clarification and choose to
                    categorize this challenge as either a Figma challenge or as a
                    redesign challenge to not skew my results.<br><br>
                    <b>Testing Takeaways</b><br>
                    • The interest-based channel following system works well, and is
                    something users expected to have <br>
                    • It was unclear to users that the category bubble can be pressed
                    again to bring use back to the Explore page <br>
                    • The preview button function was rated favourably <br><br>
                    Overall, the design was able to address a few user pain points
                    including content overload, and posting features.
