                    BDC wanted to enhance and develop new pipeline dashboards to be

                    there were data gaps and inconsistencies in the CAC work

                    referrals</b> . I sent out emails to BDC’s referred contacts of the
                    approved user research plan, explaining our intent, scheduling
                    interview times, and confirming participant’s consent for

                    As we had limited knowledge about the intricacies of how BDC
                    worked with different stakeholders, we decided that the optimal
                    way to collect qualitative data of stakeholder experience would
                    be through <b>semi-structured 1:1 or group interviews</b>. The
                    flexibility of semi-structured interviews allowed us to follow up
                    on different inquiries as the stakeholders had varying
                    experiences and needs. Originally sessions were planned for 1:1
                    for more tailored conversations, however, due to scheduling
                    difficulties there were occasional group interviews ranging from
                    2-4 participants. All group interviews had participants from the
                    same group (branch or ministry) so that their feedback could be
                    consolidated together. Sessions ranged from 30-45 min long,
                    hosted on <b>Teams</b>.

                    used for all interviews for consistency. We iteratively updated
                    the questions based off our prior interview experiences, and
                    customized some of them for specific ministry partners that had

                    Moderating stakeholder interviews occasionally presented challenges.<br><br>
                    <b style="color: #4B67E5;">1. Managing user curiosity</b><br>
                    Sometimes participants were highly curious about the specific
                    outcomes of the product, which occasionally disrupted the flow of
                    the interview. Since our research was primarily exploratory at
                    this stage, I learned to steer the discussion back to our
                    research objectives by acknowledging their curiosity and
                    reiterating the purpose of the session.<br><br>
                    <b style="color: #4B67E5;">2. Handling questions beyond my expertise</b><br>
                    Participants sometimes asked detailed questions that I couldn’t
                    fully answer due to my limited knowledge as a co-op student. To
                    address this, I made it a point to clarify my role and the scope
                    of the research at the start of the interview. If such questions
                    arose, I would assure them that their input was valuable and that
                    I would document their questions for the team to review. This
                    approach helped build trust while keeping the focus on their
                    experiences and needs.

                    <b>User Stories</b><br>
                    While completing the UX report (PowerPoint slideshow), we noticed
                    that similar points were often repeated throughout sections. This
                    was due to the interconnected nature of the BDC pipeline and
                    dashboard, as the dashboard relies on pipeline data. <br><br>
                    To address this, we restructured the report into a series of
                    themed user stories. This new format reduced repetition of small
                    details, provided a clearer narrative, and better connected the
                    "what" (user needs and insights) with the "why" (underlying
                    reasons and broader context). Themed user stories would also make
                    it easier for future co-op students to understand and translate
                    our findings into designs.<br><br>
                    <b>Impact</b><br>
                    The UX research provided the BDC team with valuable insights into
                    diverse stakeholder needs during the CAC work intake process, and
                    connect them to actionable recommendations. Key takeaways
                    clarified the desired features and functionalities for future
                    dashboard enhancements, while a pipeline data points summary
                    highlighted current data requiring consistent updates and
                    identified missing data essential for decision-making and
                    resource planning.<br><br>

                    <b>Challenges and lessons</b><br>
                    Looking back, I wish I had spent more time clarifying the BDC's
                    specific goals for an improved pipeline/dashboard before diving
                    into stakeholder needs. This would have allowed me to better
                    align the wishes of both parties and create a stronger bridge
                    between stakeholder feedback and organizational objectives during
                    interviews and final reporting.
                    This project taught me valuable lessons about navigating
                    ambiguity, honing my user interview skills, and conducting
                    thematic data analysis!
